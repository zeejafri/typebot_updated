# Contributing to Typebot

You are considering contributing to Typebot. I thank you for this üôè.

Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. It can be anything from typo fixes to new features.

Let's [discuss](https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/discussions/new) about what you want to implement before creating a PR if you are unsure about the requirements or the vision of Typebot.

Typebot is a Monorepo powered by [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/). It is composed of 2 main applications:

- the builder ([`./apps/builder`](apps/builder)), where you build your typebots
- the viewer ([`./apps/viewer`](./apps/viewer)), where your user answer the typebot

These apps are built with awesome web technologies including [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Get started

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your
   own GitHub account and then
   [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.

2. Create a new branch:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b MY_BRANCH_NAME
   ```

## Running the project locally

1. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   cd typebot.io
   pnpm i
   ```

2. Set up environment variables

   Copy [`.env.dev.example`](./.env.dev.example) to `.env`

   Check out the [Configuration guide](https://docs.typebot.io/self-hosting/configuration) if you want to enable more options

3. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) running

4. Make sure you have Node.js installed. I suggest you use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) allowing you to manage different versions. Once you installed nvm, you can install and use the latest version of Node.js: `nvm install && nvm use`

5. Start the builder and viewer

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Builder is available at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

   Viewer is available at [`http://localhost:3001`](http://localhost:3001)

   Database inspector is available at [`http://localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555)

   By default, you can easily authenticate in the builder using the "Github Sign In" button. For other options, check out the [Configuration guide](https://docs.typebot.io/self-hosting/configuration)

6. (Optionnal) Start the landing page

   Copy [`apps/landing-page/.env.local.example`](apps/landing-page/.env.local.example) to `apps/landing-page/.env.local`

   ```sh
   cd apps/landing-page
   pnpm dev
   ```

7. (Optionnal) Start the docs

   ```sh
   cd apps/docs
   pnpm start
   ```

I know the project can be a bit hard to understand at first. I'm working on improving the documentation and the codebase to make it easier to contribute. If you have any questions, feel free to [open a discussion](https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/discussions/new)

## How to create a new integration block

The first step to create a new Typebot block is to define its schema. For this you need to

1. Add your integration in the enum `IntegrationBlockType` in [`packages/schemas/features/blocks/integrations/enums.ts`](packages/schemas/features/blocks/integrations/enums.ts)
2. Create a new file in [`packages/schemas/features/blocks/integrations`](packages/schemas/features/blocks/integrations).

   Your schema should look like:

   ```ts
   import { z } from 'zod'
   import { blockBaseSchema } from '../baseSchemas'

   export const myIntegrationBlockSchema = blockBaseSchema.merge(
     z.object({
       type: z.enum([IntegrationBlockType.MY_INTEGRATION]),
       options: z.object({
         //...
       }),
     })
   )

   export type MyIntegrationBlock = z.infer<typeof myIntegrationBlockSchema>
   ```

3. Add `myIntegrationBlockSchema` to `blockSchema` in `packages/schemas/features/blocks/schemas.ts`

As soon as you have defined your schema, you can start implementing your block in the builder and the viewer.
Since the code is strictly typed, you should see exactly where you need to add your integration-specific code.

To sum it up you need to create a folder in [`apps/builder/src/features/blocks/integrations`](apps/builder/src/features/blocks/integrations) and in [`apps/viewer/src/features/blocks/integrations`](apps/viewer/src/features/blocks/integrations)
