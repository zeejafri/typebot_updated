# File upload

The File upload input block allows you to collect files from your user.

<FlowToBot
  flow={
    <img
      src="/img/blocks/inputs/file-upload-flow.png"
      width="100%"
      style={{ maxWidth: '500px' }}
      alt="File upload input in flow"
    />
  }
  bot={
    <img
      src="/img/blocks/inputs/file-upload-bot.png"
      width="100%"
      style={{ maxWidth: '500px' }}
      alt="File upload in bot"
    />
  }
/>

The placeholder accepts [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML).

## Size limit

There is a 10MB fixed limit per uploaded file. If you want your respondents to upload larger files, you should ask them to upload their files to a cloud storage service (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) and share the link with you.
