# Google Sheets

With the Google Sheets integration step, you can inject, update or get data from Google Spreadsheets. For an overview of how it works check out this video

<YoutubeEmbed videoId="UjlZvlqg6mA" />

In order to properly work, your spreadsheet must have its first row as a header row. This is how the block knows which column to update:

<img
  src="/img/blocks/integrations/spreadsheet-format.png"
  width="600"
  alt="Google Analytics block"
/>

## How to add the submission date to my row?

For this, you will need to set a new variable with the value "Now" before the Google Sheets block. Then you can simply use this variable in the Google Sheets block.

## Advanced

<YoutubeEmbed videoId="2E0gK-PwFK4" />

## Troubleshooting

The Google sheets block didn't insert or update a row but was supposed to? Make sure to check the [logs](/editor/results). If you still can't figure out what went wrong, shoot me a message using the chat button directly in the tool üëç
