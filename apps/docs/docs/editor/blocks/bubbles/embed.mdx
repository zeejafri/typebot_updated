# Embed

The Embed bubble block allows you to display a website or an iframe to your user. You can paste a video URL from many sources including YouTube, Vimeo, and mp4.

<FlowToBot
  flow={
    <img
      src="/img/blocks/bubbles/embed.png"
      width="100%"
      style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}
      alt="Embed bubble"
    />
  }
  bot={
    <video controls width="100%" style={{ maxWidth: '400px' }}>
      <source src="/img/blocks/bubbles/embed-chat.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
  }
/>

:::note
Not all websites allow embedding. If you see a blank space, it means the website you're trying to embed doesn't allow it.
