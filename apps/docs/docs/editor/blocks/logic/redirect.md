# Redirect

The Redirect logic block allows you to redirect your user to a given URL either on the current tab or in a new tab.

<img
  src="/img/blocks/logic/redirect.png"
  width="100%"
  style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}
  alt="Redirect logic block"
/>

:::caution
Safari and iOS devices will block a redirect in a new tab by default so a popup will be displayed to the user. Make sure to test your redirect logic block on these devices.
