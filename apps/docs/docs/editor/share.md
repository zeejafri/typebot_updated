# Share

Your typebot flow can be publicly shared. For this, open the Share menu and enable the `Make the flow publicly available` option:

<img
  src="/img/share.png"
  alt="Share menu"
/>

The flow can then be tested by non-authenticated guests. They are able to check all the options and can play the bot in preview mode.

<img

  alt="Guest editor"
/>
