# Welcome

[Typebot](https://www.typebot.io) is an open-source alternative to Landbot. It allows you to create conversational apps/forms (Lead qualification, Product launch, User onboarding, Customer support), embed them anywhere on your web/mobile apps, and collect results in real-time.

This is the Typebot documentation. It's a great place to find most answers. Please use the search box in the top right or the navigation menu (soon available) on the left-hand side to find the answers you're looking for.

This documentation is a work in progress.

If you can't find what you're looking for, don't hesitate to contact me directly on the web app or at support@typebot.io.
